Description:
Sugarcane, or sugar cane, or simply cane, are several species of tall perennial true grasses of the genus Saccharum, tribe Andropogoneae, used for sugar production. The plant is two to six metres (six to twenty feet) tall. It has stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are rich in sucrose, which accumulates in the stalk internodes. Sugarcane belongs to the grass family Poaceae, an economically important seed plant family that includes maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum, and many forage crops. It is native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of South Asia, Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and South America.

The global demand for sugar is the primary driver of sugarcane agriculture. Sugarcane is the world's largest crop by production quantity, with 1.9 billion tonnes produced in 2015, with Brazil accounting for 41% of the world total. In 2012, the Food and Agriculture Organization estimated it was cultivated on about 26 million hectares (64 million acres), in more than 90 countries. All sugar cane species can interbreed and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids.
